    "##Project 1: Cipher\n",
    "As promised, the way we will learn Python will be through problem solving. This means that first we will design a program based on the principles that we discussed in <a href=\"http://miokt.blogspot.com/2015/03/tutorial-2-quick-intro-to-python.html\">Tutorial 2: Why Python and Some Basic Skills</a>. We will go through all the steps. Once we get to the Coding step, I will show you how to use Python to make our program. \n",
    "The first project we will do is a cipher. A cipher is an algorithm that encrypts and decrypts information(strings). You can learn more about ciphers <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher\">here</a>. \n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Problem definition: we want to make a program that encrypts a message or password and also decrypts it back to the original text. The text is of type string. So, integers and floats and all special characters will be treated as chars in a string.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Features and functionality: do we want this program to be on some server or a website? Will this program have a graphical user interface? Will this cipher be part of a larger program? Since we don't know Python well yet, we will pick the simplest functionality for this cipher: it takes a string in the console and returns a encrypted/decrypted string. The user should be given the option between encryption or decryption.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Which features might we want to add to this program in future? This is an important question because if we decide to make this program part of a larger program in future, we have to make an API (application programming interface) for it. API is simply the way we let other programmers (or the original programmer in future) use our program. When you use printf in C, you're basically using the API of a library (stdio) in which printf is defined. Instead of using the functions in that library, you simply use the printf function. Everything else is handled by the library itself. Since we will be using this cipher as a part of another program in future, we have to make a nice API for our program. This means that when your module is imported into another project, the user will have to use only a couple of functions from your module. In our case, one function encrypts and the other decrypts.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The outline of the solution: we need to specify now how we will encrypt and decrypt the strings that the user gives us.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Detailed solution: which encryption algorithm are we going to use? What data structures do we need?</li>\n",
    "    <li>The pseudocode: how do we break the solution into functions?</li>\n",
    "    <li>Designing tests: we need to design tests for each function so that we know exactly what the function does and if the function does really what we need it to? Also, coding functions this way will help us get rid of most bugs before they even occur.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Writing Python code for the functions and testing the functions: now we can start coding.</li>\n",

    "Making functions polymorphic is such a big pain in C++ and Java that most people avoid this topic. The reason for this is that in these languages function parameters and return values have types.<br>\n",
    "As you know by now, Python doesn't use types. So, making a function polymorphic does not include any more steps than defining regular function.<br>\n",
    "Let's see this in action: we want to make a function that checks the value of a variable."
