    "### Git Intro\n",
    "Git is a version control system. Professional developers use it and you should, too. Almost all job postings require the candidate to know Git or some other version control system. And, I don't mean the GUI application or GitHub; I mean the command line tool that we're going to learn here. So, pay attention!<br>\n",
    "Git keeps track of the changes you make to your files in a project so that going back to an earlier version of your code would be easy. Going back between different versions of your code is as easy as typing a command. The details of how this is done is invisible to you, so that you see and use the same files no matter which version of your code you're using.<br>\n",
    "Another feature of Git is that it makes it easier for groups to work on the same project. Each team can make a copy of the original code, work on it without touching the original code, and merge the final code with other people's code.<br>\n",
    "What we are going to do in this tutorial is:<br>\n",
    "* Learn the different concepts of version control.\n",
    "* Learn the most useful Git commands.\n",
    "* Make a GitHub account and set it up to work with Git.\n",
    "* A Git and GitHub software development workflow<br>\n",

If you get stuck somewhere, you can watch the follwoing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYjZtU1-u9Y\">video tutorial</a> instead of this tutorial. But, I think this tutorial goes through things at a slower pace than the videos and explains things a bit more clearly.\n"
